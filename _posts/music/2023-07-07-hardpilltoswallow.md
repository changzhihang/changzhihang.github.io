what happened how did everything turn so cold  
we can talk about it 'till I'm turning blue in the face
I can laugh about it joke about it never the same
I can keep pretending it don't cause any pain
It's a never ending cycle that just can't be tamed
early in my life I was put to the test
I had to make some choices or forget about the rest
And when I speak this fire you get nothing but the best
Let me tell you something that you'd better not forget
There's a long road in front of you
There's a hard life behind you
There's a war been waged inside you
You've got big footsteps to follow
You've got a soul that's barely hollow
And that's a hard pill to swallow
